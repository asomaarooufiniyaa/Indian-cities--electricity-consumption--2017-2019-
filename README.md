# Indian Electricity Consumption Analysis (2017-2019)

## Overview  
This project focuses on analyzing electricity consumption data of Indian cities from 2017 to 2019. 
The dataset includes various categories of electricity usage such as domestic, commercial, industrial, and public purposes. 
The primary goal of this project is to clean the dataset, perform basic analysis, and create interactive visualizations.

---

## Features  
- **Data Cleaning:**  
  - Renamed columns for better readability.  
  - Replaced null values with zero to ensure consistency.  
  - Stored the cleaned data in an Excel file for further use.  

- **Data Analysis:**  
  - Identified cities with the highest and lowest domestic electricity consumption.  
  - Provided a summary of electricity usage across different purposes.  

- **Data Visualization:**  
  - Created an interactive Power BI dashboard to explore electricity consumption trends across cities and categories.
